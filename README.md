### Architecture
1. Model View View Model - Stores data and updates the views and models accordingly.
2. Clean architecture - Data, Domain, Presentation - VM and UI layers.


### Libraries And Frameworks
1. Kotlin - Language used in android apps.
2. Jetpack Compose - Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI.
3. Kotlin Coroutines - Fetching async data along flow.
4. Kotlin Coroutines Flow - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values.
6. ViewModel - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
7. Dependency Injection (DI) - Hilt - Easier way to incorporate Dagger DI into Android apps.
8. Retrofit - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
9. Room - For caching data within the app
11. Mockito - Mocking object injections, unit testing the viewmodel and repositories
